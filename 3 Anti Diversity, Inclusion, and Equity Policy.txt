Anti Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Policy

The Era Entresol is for entertainment only and will not succumb to the demands of the world.
Diversity, inclusion, and equity have no place here.
I believe in merit and objective reality.
There are two genders.
Man and woman.
A child can only be produced by a man and a woman.
The best person should always be selected for the job.
You have failed to select the best people.
You have failed to produce results.
Your failures reflect your ideals.
Your word is as good as the paper I wipe my ass with.
The best part is...who's going to stop me?
You can't be cancelled if you ignore the vocal minority of town idiots.
This has been proven time and time again.
I challenge you.
Prove me wrong.
I know that you can't.
Both me and my God laugh at you.
The only thing I have to do to destroy you is wait.
I don't even have to lift a single finger.
Your own incompetence will be your undoing.
